# Simple CRUD with MongoDB

This program was made in purpose to learn the basic code to make a connection between php and mongoDB.
And as for that, the source code here is very simple and basic, please dont expect more.

## Getting Started

For deploying and running this application, make sure your local machine has installed web server (i.e: apache) and mongoDB driver. 
I won't specify the installation here because each machine has its own procedure.

### Installing

* Extract the file that has downloaded from here to your web server root directory (i.e: htdocs).
* Open it in your browser, it's simmiliar to "http://localhost/projectname/".
* And there you can operate it nicely. After that you can customize it in your own by editing each file, especially config.php to connect to another database if necessary.

## Built With

* [PHP](http://php.net) - The back-end programming language used
